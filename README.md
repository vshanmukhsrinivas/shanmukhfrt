Azure Project

Pavan Edu-platform

To create a web application for the students to access the free resources for their career progress with different categories and also implement a chat bot service to get more resources for students.

The website is mostly useful for the students to access a free resources for their career progress and also to do certifications of their interested courses.
Also I have implemented a chat bot using Azure services to help students to get more information or to give a feedback on a particular course. Qna maker service used for this web application.
